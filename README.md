BDMM
====

The BDMM project provides a [BEAST 2](http://www.beast2.org/) package for
performing phylodynamic inference under a structured birth-death model.

Note that this repository contains only the source code for the package and
will therefore be of interest only to programmers.  A binary release for this
package will be provided soon.

Together with the BDMM package binaries, BDMM requires an up-to-date
installation of [BEAST 2](http://www.beast2.org) together with the following
packages in order to run:

* [MASTER](http://compevol.github.io/MASTER)
* [MultiTypeTree](http://compevol.github.io/MultiTypeTree)
* [sampled-ancestors](https://github.com/CompEvol/sampled-ancestors)
